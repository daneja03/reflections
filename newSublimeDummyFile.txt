chanHow did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Diff clearly indicates the line numbers which are different in both the files. It also shows the contents on that line number.
no+ and - signs in front of the line numbers helps you to recognize whether there has been new additions or deletions from that line.
If the files are large it only shows those line numbers which are different in two different versions.
