When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Projects are carried out by teams and each team can have multiple number of persons that contributes to the repository.
Also teams may geographically apart, working from different locations. So a remote repository works as a central place where
each team member can add or modify contents and then other team mates can pull them on their local machines. Other benefit 
is that all your changes remains on cloud rather than any local machine, so they are always available.
